# Trees

## Features

- Node

  - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

- Binary Tree

  - Create a Binary Tree class
    - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
      - pre order
      - in order
      - post order
    - Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

- Binary Search Tree

  - Create a Binary Search Tree class
    - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
    - Add
      - Arguments: value
      - Return: nothing
      - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    - Contains
      - Argument: value
      - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Testing Functionality

- Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
- For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node
- Can successfully return a collection from a pre-order traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from an in-order traversal
- Can successfully return a collection from a post-order traversal
