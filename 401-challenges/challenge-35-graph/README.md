# Graphs

## Features

- add vertex

  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: The added vertex
  - Add a vertex to the graph

- add edge

  - Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph
  - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  - Both vertices should already be in the Graph

- get vertices

  - Arguments: none
  - Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
  - Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

- get neighbors

  - Arguments: vertex
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex
    - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
  - Empty collection returned if there are no vertices

- size

  - Arguments: none
  - Returns the total number of vertices in the graph
  - 0 if there are none

## Testing

- Vertex can be successfully added to the graph
- An edge can be successfully added to the graph
- A collection of all vertices can be properly retrieved from the graph
- All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
- Neighbors are returned with the weight between vertices included
- The proper size is returned, representing the number of vertices in the graph
- A graph with only one vertex and edge can be properly returned
